`.editable` provides style for frontend edit links. This are useful in CMS sites where the site builder wants to provide the admin with an edit link from a specific piece of content on the frontend.

The edit link appears when hovering over the element with an `.editable` class. The edit link is positioned relative to this element, but if you wish to place it elsewehre, create a `<div>` with a class of `.editable__placer` with the edit link inside of that.
