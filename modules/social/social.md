Logo icons for various social media sites. Can be used for "Find us on X site"
or sharing links. Logos come from Font Awesome and can be rendered normal or in
square versions (using `.social--square` class).

This module can be used for linking to a site's social accounts, or as sharing links.

When used as sharing links, the js class `.js-social-share` can be used for the pop. This class has been added to Facebook and Twitter as an example.

A good quick start for creating sare URLs is [sharelinkgenerator.com](http://www.sharelinkgenerator.com), with more info being available in each site's documentation.
